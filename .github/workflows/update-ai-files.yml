            This PR was automatically created after doc changes were pushed to `main`.

            **Updated files:**
            - `skills/cadence/SKILL.md` — AI agent skill reference (regenerated by Claude)

            > `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` are served dynamically by the app — no static files needed.

            Review the diff and merge if the changes look correct.
