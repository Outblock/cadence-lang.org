title: LLM Endpoints
---

The site exposes plain-text endpoints optimized for LLM context windows. These are useful for RAG pipelines or injecting Cadence documentation directly into prompts.

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| [`/llms.txt`](/llms.txt) | Index of all documentation pages with links |
| [`/llms-full.txt`](/llms-full.txt) | Complete documentation as plain text |

## llms.txt

A lightweight index listing every documentation page with its title and URL. Use this when you need to find the right page before fetching its full content.

```bash
curl https://cadence-lang.org/llms.txt
```

## llms-full.txt

The complete processed markdown for all documentation pages, concatenated into a single file. Use this when you want to inject the entire Cadence knowledge base into an LLM context window.

```bash
curl https://cadence-lang.org/llms-full.txt
```

:::tip
You can also append `.mdx` to any documentation URL to get raw markdown for a single page. For example: `https://cadence-lang.org/docs/language/resources.mdx`
