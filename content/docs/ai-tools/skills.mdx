[Skills](https://skills.sh) let you add domain knowledge to your AI coding agent with one command. The Cadence skill bundles the complete language reference, design patterns, security best practices, and code examples.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add outblock/cadence-lang.org
```

This adds a `SKILL.md` file to your project that your AI agent reads automatically. No configuration needed.

## What the skill includes

- Language fundamentals (types, resources, capabilities, access control)
- Contract patterns (FT, NFT, marketplace, governance)
- Security best practices and anti-patterns
- Testing framework reference
- Links to documentation and LLM-optimized endpoints

## Supported agents

Any agent that reads project-level context files works out of the box:

| Agent | Support |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | Reads `SKILL.md` automatically |
| Cursor | Reads via project rules |
| Windsurf | Reads via project context |
| GitHub Copilot | Reads via `.github/copilot-instructions.md` |
