Configure [Antigravity](https://antigravity.dev) to work with Cadence.

## Install the Cadence skill

```bash
npx skills add outblock/cadence-lang.org
```

Antigravity reads project-level context files automatically, so `SKILL.md` is picked up on startup.

## Add MCP server

Add the Cadence MCP server to your Antigravity configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cadence": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://cadence-mcp.up.railway.app/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

This gives Antigravity access to all [MCP tools](../mcp-server) — documentation search, code checking, type inspection, and more.
