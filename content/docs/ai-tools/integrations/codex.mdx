Configure OpenAI Codex (the CLI agent) to work with Cadence.

## Install the Cadence skill

```bash
npx skills add outblock/cadence-lang.org
```

Codex reads project-level context files, so `SKILL.md` is picked up automatically.

## Add instructions

Create or update your `AGENTS.md` file in the project root:

```markdown
## Cadence Development

This project uses Cadence, the smart contract language for the Flow blockchain.
Refer to SKILL.md for the complete language reference.

Key conventions:
- Use `access(all)` for public access, not `pub`
- Resources use `@` prefix and must be moved with `<-`
- Always handle resources — they cannot be lost or copied
- Use capability-based access control with entitlements
```

## Context injection

For direct API usage, inject the Cadence documentation into the system prompt:

```bash
curl -s https://cadence-lang.org/llms-full.txt
```
