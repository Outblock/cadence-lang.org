Configure Google Gemini to work with Cadence.

## Gemini CLI

### Install the Cadence skill

```bash
npx skills add outblock/cadence-lang.org
```

Gemini CLI reads project context files, so `SKILL.md` is picked up automatically.

### Add instructions

Create a `GEMINI.md` file in your project root:

```markdown
## Cadence Development

This project uses Cadence, the smart contract language for the Flow blockchain.
Refer to SKILL.md for the complete language reference.

Key conventions:
- Use `access(all)` for public access, not `pub`
- Resources use `@` prefix and must be moved with `<-`
- Always handle resources — they cannot be lost or copied
- Use capability-based access control with entitlements
```

## Gemini API

When using the Gemini API, inject Cadence context into the system instruction:

```bash
# Fetch the full documentation
curl -s https://cadence-lang.org/llms-full.txt
```

Or fetch specific pages from the [LLM endpoints](../llm-endpoints).
