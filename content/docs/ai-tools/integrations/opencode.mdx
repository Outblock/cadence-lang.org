Configure [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) to work with Cadence.

## Install the Cadence skill

```bash
npx skills add outblock/cadence-lang.org
```

OpenCode reads project-level context files automatically.

## Add MCP server

Add the Cadence MCP server to your OpenCode configuration:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "cadence": {
      "type": "remote",
      "url": "https://cadence-mcp.up.railway.app/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

This gives OpenCode access to all [MCP tools](./mcp-server) — documentation search, code checking, type inspection, and more.
