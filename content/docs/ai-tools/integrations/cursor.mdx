Configure Cursor to understand Cadence smart contracts.

## Install the Cadence skill

```bash
npx skills add outblock/cadence-lang.org
```

This adds a `SKILL.md` file to your project. Cursor reads it automatically as project context.

## Add project rules

You can also create a `.cursor/rules` file to reinforce Cadence-specific behavior:

```
When working with .cdc files, follow the Cadence language conventions.
Refer to SKILL.md for the complete Cadence reference.
Use resource-oriented patterns. Never copy resources — always move them with <-.
```

## Add MCP server

In Cursor settings, add a new MCP server:

- **Name**: `cadence`
- **Type**: `command`
- **Command**: `npx -y mcp-remote https://cadence-mcp.up.railway.app/mcp`

This gives Cursor access to the Cadence [MCP tools](./mcp-server) for documentation search and code checking.
