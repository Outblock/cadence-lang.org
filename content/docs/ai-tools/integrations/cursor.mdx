Configure Cursor to understand Cadence smart contracts.

## Install the Cadence skill

```bash
npx skills add outblock/cadence-lang.org
```

This adds a `SKILL.md` file to your project. Cursor reads it automatically as project context.

## Add project rules

You can also create a `.cursor/rules` file to reinforce Cadence-specific behavior:

```
When working with .cdc files, follow the Cadence language conventions.
Refer to SKILL.md for the complete Cadence reference.
Use resource-oriented patterns. Never copy resources — always move them with <-.
```

## Add MCP server

[![Install in Cursor](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=cadence&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoibnB4IiwiYXJncyI6WyIteSIsIm1jcC1yZW1vdGUiLCJodHRwczovL2NhZGVuY2UtbWNwLnVwLnJhaWx3YXkuYXBwL21jcCJdfQ==)

Or manually add in Cursor settings:

- **Name**: `cadence`
- **Type**: `command`
- **Command**: `npx -y mcp-remote https://cadence-mcp.up.railway.app/mcp`

This gives Cursor access to the Cadence [MCP tools](../mcp-server) for documentation search and code checking.
