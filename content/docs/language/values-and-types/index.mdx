title: Values and Types
---

Values are handled in the following way:

- Values are objects (e.g., booleans, integers, or arrays).
- Values are typed.

See the following articles to learn more about values and types:

- [Booleans, Numeric Literals, and Integers]
- [Fixed-Point Numbers and Functions]
- [Minimum and Maximum Values, Saturation Arithmetic, and Floating-Point Numbers]
- [Addresses and Address Functions]
- [AnyStruct/AnyResource, Optionals, and Never]
- [Strings and Characters]
- [Arrays]
- [Dictionaries]
- [InclusiveRange]
